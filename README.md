# 📺 Netflix Dataset Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix Titles Dataset using Python and Matplotlib. It explores trends and insights related to the platform's content through visual storytelling.

# 🔍 Key Features
📊 Movies vs TV Shows: Bar chart showing the distribution of content types.

🥧 Rating Distribution: Pie chart representing the percentage of content across various age ratings.

⏱️ Movie Duration Analysis: Histogram visualizing the distribution of movie lengths.

📅 Release Year Trends: Scatter plot showing the number of movies released each year.

🌍 Top 10 Countries: Horizontal bar graph of countries producing the most content.

📈 Content Trends Over Time: Line plots showing yearly trends for both movies and TV shows.

# 🧹 Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned by removing null entries in key columns such as:

type

release_year

rating

country

duration

Movie durations were also converted from strings (e.g., "90 min") to integers for better analysis.
